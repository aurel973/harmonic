# harmonic


Hi all !


I'm a web developper who was interested in understanding how and why music.
I started with Fourrier analyse.
As I would have a visual shema about that, I finally decided to show that on a piano keyboard.
I did code that using JavaScript to be web full and using SVG to draw the all and get events on each key.
I used de JavaScript Sound API to generate simple sound.

An then here is the result.
